### MG1 — Continuum reproduction of the published Model G soliton
Status: PRE-REGISTERED 2026-10-27 (MG001b), with PI sign-off on the criteria below; reviewed by ChatGPT (round 2). No MG1 run preceded this commit.

Reference: `spec/model_g_published.md` (Pulver & LaViolette 2013, eq. 17 parameters, Table 1).

Setup: dimensionless eqs. 7a–7c; eq. 17 parameters; seed eq. 18 added to the X equation;
φ = 0 initially; t ∈ [0, 100]. 1D Cartesian x ∈ [−50, 50]; 2D and 3D radial r ∈ [0, 50];
Dirichlet φ = 0 at the outer edge, Neumann at the center. Method-of-lines finite differences
with a stiff implicit integrator (our choice; the paper does not report its method).

Prediction: a stationary soliton forms in 1D, 2D and 3D, matching Table 1.

Pass criteria (all must hold):
1. Turing wavelength λ₀ = 3.08 ± 2% in 1D, 2D and 3D (measured as in the paper: twice the
   mean zero spacing).
2. Core amplitudes (Table 1 row a) for φ_G, φ_X, φ_Y within ±3% in 1D, 2D, 3D.
3. Core radii (row b) within ±3%.
4. Stationarity: max |∂φ/∂t| < 10⁻⁴ at t = 100.
5. Grid convergence: criteria 1–3 change by < 0.5% when the grid spacing is halved.

Fail criterion: any pass criterion fails at the converged resolution. Partial reproduction is
reported row by row, not rounded to a pass.

Null controls:
- N1: no seed → max |φ| < 10⁻⁶ at t = 100 (homogeneous state stable; consistent with the
  MG001 linear check, max Re σ = −0.195).
- N2 (exploratory, not pass/fail): seed amplitude scaled by 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 → report whether a
  soliton nucleates and estimate the nucleation threshold amplitude. This feeds MG3.

Diagnostic (not pass/fail; added MG001a, corrected MG001b): integral balances. At R = 50, 100
and 200, report I_S, the measured boundary fluxes F_S, **and the integrated time derivatives**
dI_G/dt and d(I_G + I_X + I_Y)/dt. Check both time-dependent balances in
`model_g_published.md` §9.2 before dropping any term. A pointwise tolerance |∂φ/∂t| < 10⁻⁴ does
not guarantee small integrated residuals: the 3D ball of radius 50 has volume ≈ 5.24 × 10⁵.
The balance-error budget includes spatial discretization, time integration, boundary
differentiation and quadrature. Each is estimated from the grid- and tolerance-refinement runs.
Expected: balances close within that budget, and I_G, I_X → 0 as R grows. A Table 1 row (e)
mismatch at R = 50 counts as consistent only if the *measured* fluxes and time derivatives
account for it.

Out of scope for MG1 (later stages): the 2Dδ variant, multi-particle bonding (3.303 / 3.314),
gradient drift (v = −0.0599 m).

| Criterion | 1D | 2D | 3D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 λ₀ ±2% | PASS (3.0756, −0.14%) | PASS (3.0766, −0.11%) | PASS (3.0793, −0.02%) |
| 2 amplitudes ±3% | PASS (≤0.15%) | PASS (≤0.30%) | PASS (≤0.23%) |
| 3 core radii ±3% | PASS (≤0.05%) | PASS (≤0.30%) | PASS (≤0.11%) |
| 4 max \|∂φ/∂t\| < 1e-4 at t=100 | **FAIL (3.5e-4)** | PASS (1.4e-10) | PASS (1.3e-8) |
| 5 grid halving < 0.5% | PASS (0.20%) | PASS (0.01%) | PASS (0.01%) |

- **Verdict as registered: FAIL.** 14 of 15 cells pass. The single failure is 1D stationarity at
  t = 100. The 1D soliton is still relaxing there (an exponential mode with rate ≈ 0.047, converged
  under grid and tolerance refinement). It is stationary by t = 300 (3e-8), where φ_X(0) has moved
  0.1% (−8.372 → −8.365). The paper's 1D Table 1 values match our t = 100 snapshot (within 0.15%),
  so the paper's 1D column is itself a pre-stationary snapshot. This is a property of the published
  protocol, not a reproduction error. PI ruling requested on whether MG1 counts as passed with this
  documented exception.
- Unregistered rows also reproduce: RMS radii and core integrals agree within 0.5%, except 2D
  core ∫φ_G (−1.4%).
- **Table 1 row (e) (full integrals) is NOT reproduced for G and X.** Stationary I_G and I_X are
  ≤ 5e-8 (2D/3D, R = 50) against the paper's 2.88e-3 and 2.87e-2 (I_G), 0.128 and 1.93 (I_X).
  The measured boundary fluxes at R = 50 are ≤ 1.2e-7, so finite-boundary flux does **not**
  explain the paper's values. Nonstationarity does not either (2D/3D are stationary to ≤ 1e-8).
  The remaining candidates are numerical/quadrature error in the paper's integration or a
  tabulation inconsistency. I_Y differs by +1.5% (2D) and +5.6% (3D), whereas core integrals
  agree, which points to the paper's tail quadrature.
- Integral identity confirmed numerically: I_G, I_X are at round-off × volume level for
  R = 50, 100, 200 once stationary. Discrete balance residuals ≤ 4e-7 scale with domain volume
  (round-off). In 1D at t = 100, the nonzero I_G, I_X (≈ 2e-6, 2e-5) are carried by
  dI/dt ≠ 0 (nonstationarity), as the review anticipated.
- Null controls: N1 PASS (max |φ| ≤ 4e-14, all dims; a 1e-3 seed decays to ≤ 3e-11).
  N2 nucleation thresholds (seed-amplitude scale, judged at t = 100, sub-threshold confirmed to
  t = 400): **1D 0.975, 2D 0.572, 3D 0.486**. The published seed is only 2.5% above threshold in 1D.
- Solver note: scipy BDF step control failed on the 3D zero-seed run (state at round-off). It is
  retried automatically with an explicit first step, and the retry is recorded in `controls.json`.
  There was no effect on any seeded run.
